1. Start
2. Initialize variables:
   - length = 0           
   - words = 0            
   - vowels = 0           
   - sentence = input sentence 
3. Process each character in the sentence:
   FOR each character c in sentence DO
       a. Increment length by 1
       b. If c is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'), then:
          - Increment vowels by 1
       c. If c is a space (' '), then:
          - Increment words by 1
4. After the loop, check if the last character is a period ('.'):
   a. If the last character is a period, increment words by 1 (since the last word does not have a space after it)
5. Display the results:
   - Print "Length of the sentence: " + length
   - Print "Number of words: " + words
   - Print "Number of vowels: " + vowels
